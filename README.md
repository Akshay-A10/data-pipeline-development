# 🔄 Data Pipeline Development - Task

This project demonstrates the development of a simple data pipeline that performs *data extraction, **transformation, and **loading (ETL)* using Python.

---

## 📌 Objective

The main objective is to build a functional and reusable data pipeline that:
- Extracts data from a CSV file
- Cleans and transforms the data (e.g., handling missing values, encoding, scaling)
- Loads the processed data into a new file or storage system (CSV/database)

---

## ⚙ Tools and Libraries Used

- Python 3.x
- pandas – Data manipulation and analysis
- scikit-learn – Preprocessing (e.g., SimpleImputer, StandardScaler)
- os – For handling file paths
